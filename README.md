# A Password to Remember 
A password generating web application. Currently in development. 

## Description ## 
Developed to address the issue of requiring many different complex passwords for different
websites/accounts. Addresses the downside of Google generated passwords which are impossible 
to remember by allowing the user to develop a personal password using meaningful questions. 

The user can choose up to 3 questions from a list and specify the requirements of the password
(i.e. minimum length, special characters, etc). The application then generates a password that 
incorporates the question answers and satisfies the specified requirements.
